# Dictionary

Language in Python which uses an Excel file as the source (database) to show result to users. The program only needs to be English-to-Dari or English-to-Pashto,  its not required to working the other way.
program should first ask the user for the English word, then should prompt for the language that user needs the word to be translated to (Dari/Pashto).

 - The application ask the user to enter English word to transalte, it then prompt the user to choose the language of translation either Dari or pashto
 - If the entered word does not exists in the dictionary it prompt the user if he/she wants to add the word in the Dictionary.
 - If wants to add new word, it calls newdic() function in add_new_word.py the user will be asked to enter the Dari and pashto translation of the word, and then it adds the word to dictionary.
